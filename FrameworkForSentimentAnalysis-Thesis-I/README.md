# Framework For Social Network Sentiment Analysis Using Big Data Analytics
This the first part of my thesis work, which concentrated on developing a Social Network Sentiment Analysis for a domain. Here for the case-study, I choose automobile industry, Spark as a tool for big data anlytics tools and twitter as a social networking site. This is a generalised framework and can be extended to perform sentiment analysis on other domains like Health care, banking, etc.

The notebook(Twitter_Spark_Sentiment.ipynb) contains full approach and explanation along with the program code.

<h4><b>Note:</b></h4> 
<b>I highly recommend viewing this notebook in the below link as github is unable to show tableau and plotly embeds.</b>
