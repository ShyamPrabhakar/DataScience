# Cost Analysis By Customer Churn Prediction Using Different Models

This model involves cost analysis by predicting churn class customers by comparing different models.

For POC(Proof Of Concept) purpose, I build the model using a telecom dataset.
Other than normal machine learning concepts, this model involves few important concepts
like cost matrix, adaptive thresholding and cost curves. 

This model was shown to Regions Bank to make it productionized. They were quite excited after seeing this and want me implement me to implement this model for their customer data.

The notebook(churn.ipynb) contains full approach and explanation along with the program code.

<h4><b>Note:</b></h4> 
<b>I highly recommend viewing this notebook in the below link as github is unable to show tableau and plotly embeds.</b>
