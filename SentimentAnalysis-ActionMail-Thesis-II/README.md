# Sentiment Analysis Framework For A Single Entity With An Action Mail System

This is the second part of my thesis, where I concentrated on developing a sentiment analysis framework for single entity. For case-study porpose, I choose Regions Bank and collected tweets using Twitter Rest Api. The framework consists of a new concept called Action Mail System, which automatically detects the alarm level condition and sends mail to the particular entity.

I developed a new sentiment module, which is a generalised sentiment module and can be used in any program just by importing this module into the code.

The main notebook(SingleEntityFramework.ipynb) has all the program code and appraoch for implementing the framework and the notebook(Sentiment_Module.ipynb) has the code and explanation for the generalised sentiment module.
